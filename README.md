Phone Name System (PNS)

Goal: Replace phone numbers with human-readable names — just like how DNS replaces IP addresses.

Concept

Every phone number today is like an IP address — hard to remember, not human-friendly.
The Phone Name System (PNS) maps numbers to names so your phone can display “@username” instead of “+1-617-555-9321.”
